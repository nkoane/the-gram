# The Gram â€“ Instagram Profile Mockup

This classroom exercise is designed to help you practice HTML and CSS by creating a mockup of an Instagram profile page.

## Objective

Recreate the layout and basic styling of an Instagram profile page using only HTML and CSS. You will focus on structuring the page, using CSS Grid and Flexbox, and applying custom styles to mimic the look and feel of a real profile.

## Instructions

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Open `index.html` and `main.css` in your code editor.
3. Study the existing structure:
   - The left section displays a profile avatar.
   - The right section contains the profile name.
4. Expand the mockup by adding:
   - A profile picture, username, and bio.
   - A section for posts (use placeholder images or colored boxes).
   - Follower and following counts.
   - Any other elements you notice on a real Instagram profile.
5. Use only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required).

## Tips

- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout.
- Use placeholder images or avatars (e.g., [DiceBear Avatars](https://www.dicebear.com/)).
- Keep your code organized and well-commented.
